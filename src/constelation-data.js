It represents a bird-of-paradise, and its name means \"without feet\" in Greek because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756. Apus is best seen in the southern hemisphere during the spring months. It is not visible from the northern hemisphere. The brightest star in Apus is Alpha Apodis, which has a magnitude of 4.2. Apus also contains a number of deep sky objects, including the NGC 6134 open cluster and the IC 4499 planetary nebula. Apus is a relatively new constellation, and it is not as well-known as some of the other constellations in the southern sky. However, it is a beautiful constellation, and it is a great way to learn more about the night sky.",

        description: "Aquila is a constellation on the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird that carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greek-Roman mythology. Visible at latitudes between +90° and −75°. Best visible at 21:00 (9 p.m.) during the month of August. Its brightest star, Altair, is one vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the northern summer, as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and galaxies are few. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase al-nasr al-tair, meaning \"the flying eagle\". Altair has a magnitude of 0.76. It is one of the three stars of the Summer Triangle, along with Vega and Deneb. It is an A-type main-sequence star with 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. The star rotates quickly, and this gives the star an oblate shape where it is flattened towards the poles. Aquila is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations, and it was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It is associated with the element of air and with the zodiac sign Sagittarius. Aquila is a popular target for amateur astronomers.
